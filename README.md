# NodeJS + Express + Typescript Starter Kit

This is a starter kit based on [TypeScript-Node-Starter](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript-Node-Starter)

I decided to do this as a close to barebones starter for anyone looking to spin up a simple
[NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) + [Express](https://expressjs.com/) server with [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/index.html#download-links) integration and [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for testing.

The kit provided at [TypeScript-Node-Starter](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript-Node-Starter) is quite comprehensive and includes integrations
for MongoDB, Authentication and more.
